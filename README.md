# "All_of_the_above: The Coding Quiz Game

## Description

In this assignment we were tasked to build, design, and create a short coding quiz. The focus was to test basic coding material. 
When the site is openened, users will land on the: start page, with a button allowing them start the timed quiz. 
The user gets :60 seconds to complete the quiz, and answer as many questions correctly as they are able to. If the user selects an incorrect answer, they will have :10seconds deducted from their time. 

Once they have either successfully, or unsuccessfully completed the quiz; the user will be brought to a page where they may enter their initials to store with the score they've recieved. Along with storing their score, the user may navigate to the 'View High Scores' page - via button located on the main page, to view a list of other user's scores. High scores aare listed in hierarchal ranking.

## Approach

There is JavaScript, HTML, Flex, and LocalStorage being utlized to create this quiz-gam website.
With JScript specifically, we are able to show and hide different elements on the page, as well as animate certain buttons to perform specific actions.
Flex is being used to manipulate certain elements: adding a quick-response, clean display & trasnition between screens, and when buttons are clicked.
Localstorage is utilized to save individual-user's scores, as well as recall and rank said scores.
